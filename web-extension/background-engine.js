/*
 * /!\  IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ  /!\
 *
 * There are many reasons in this web-extension for the existence of the
 * "background" or "extension" page (which uses this script as an entry-point).
 *
 * First of all, many contraints are pushed onto the web-extension development
 * by various security features of the browsers:
 *  - CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) prevents any piece of code from
 *  calling specific APIs or loading URLs that are not authorized beforehands
 *  by the website's developer. This makes the job of a web-extension more
 *  complex, as many thing are now authorized depending on the context.
 *  - Permission specification (manifest) & limitations based on the context of
 *  the script
 *
 * This has many implications including:
 * - Sidebar (frame loading the extension's URL) has no right to inspect the
 *   parent frame's DOM
 * - Sidebar (frame loading the extension's URL) cannot interact with browser
 *   storage
 *
 * Also, in a concern to keep the manifest duplication as small as possible for
 * each of the readers supported, we've chosen to:
 * - Avoid loading all reader support scripts into all pages
 *
 * All these constraints (most of which are enforced by the browser) led us to
 * increasingly consider the extension page as a central HUB for messaging, and
 * interacting with the storage implementation, explaining why:
 *  - All reader support scripts are loaded into the extension page
 *  - The extension script is mostly about handling messages and computing
 *    stuff on behalf of other scripts.
 *  - A lot of apparently simple logics have become a multi-step process of
 *    message exchanges and computations
